# First static webpage with HTML and CSS only


:rocket: This was one the first challenges in the beginning of the first chapter in the BeCode formation, The Field.

## :sparkles: What were the objectives?

- Learning on the basis of a customer's request
- Make an onepage based on a model made by a webdesigner (try to make it look as similar as possible)
- CSS positioning
- Using the right semantic tags. 

## :grey_question: What was provided?

- pictures
- the wireframe
- fonts to use

## :thinking: What was the result?
